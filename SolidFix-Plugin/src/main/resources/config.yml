# The plugin by default checks your server version to determine if a block fix is necessary and disables itself accordingly.
# In the latest versions of the game, Mojang has been fairly successful at removing this block issue through the client.
# If you are convinced the issue still occurs on your server but the plugin is disabling itself - set this option to True.
Override Version Check: False

# Define the maximum ping that a player would need to be classified as a low or medium priority.
# Ping rates are measured in (ms).
# Do not change this if you are not sure what you are doing.
Priorities:
  LOW:
    Max Ping: 150
  MEDIUM:
    Max Ping: 300

# This sets for the cooldown (ms) necessary between block breaks for this plugin to begin updating nearby blocks for the player
# The sensitivity is organized by priority.
# Priorities (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) are determined based off of the player's ping.
# A player with good ping will be considered low priority for the plugin for example.
# Players with high ping rates will be more likely to experience more frequent ghost blocks

# Smaller Number = Optimizes performance in exchange for accuracy
# Unit: Milliseconds
Block Break Sensitivity:
  LOW: 150
  MEDIUM: 300

# changing worlds or connecting to the server within the first several seconds.
